## SuccessfulReceipt type

Indicates that the transaction has succeeded.

<b>Signature:</b>

export declare type SuccessfulReceipt<R = unknown, D = unknown> = {
    status: 'succeeded';
    rawReceipt: R;
    details: D;
};
```

The `rawReceipt` property is an implementation-specific transaction receipt object.

The `details` property may contain more information about the transaction. See the return types of  functions for the exact contents of `details` for each type of Rmm transaction.
